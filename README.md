# MERN Stack Car Rental Website

A full-featured Car Rental web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).  
The platform allows users to browse available cars, check prices, make bookings, manage reservations, and process payments.  
The admin dashboard enables vehicle management, booking monitoring, and customer data handling.

## Architecture
The project follows a **client-server architecture**:
- **Client (React.js)** — Renders the UI and communicates with backend APIs
- **Server (Express.js)** — Handles authentication, business logic, and database operations
- **Database (MongoDB)** — Stores cars, bookings, and user data
- **Payment Gateway (Stripe/PayPal)** — Processes transactions securely

If you want, I can **extend this README** with **sample API request/response examples** for the Car Rental Website, so developers can directly test endpoints in Postman without guessing payload formats. That would make it even more complete.  

Do you want me to add those?
